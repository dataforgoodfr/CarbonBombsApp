            40% of the 425 carbon bombs had not started extraction in 2020.
            Those 169 projects amount to one third of the carbon bombsâ€™
            cumulated emissions. It is still time to act in order to cancel
            them. There is also a way to limit the cumulated emissions of the
            256 existing carbon bombs: stopping any further investments they
            could receive, in order to put them into a pathway of natural
            decline of their oil, gas, and coal outputs.
