      <p>
        Carbon bombs are fossil fuel projects that generate massive amounts of
        CO2 emissions and are likely to significantly threaten the 1.5°C climate
        target.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-2'>
        425 carbon bombs, spread across 28 countries, are likely to individually{' '}
        <b>generate more than one billion tons of CO2</b> over their lifetime.
      </p>
      <p className='mt-2'>
        The full operation of these 425 carbon bombs will emit twice as much CO2
        as would be required to stay below 1.5°C of global warming.
